## Wondrous

The **Wondrous Sequence** is generated by the simple rule:

* If the current term is even, the next term is half the current term.
* If the current term is odd, the next term is three times the current term, plus 1.

For example, the sequence generated by starting with `3` is:

```txt
3 -> 10 -> 5 -> 16 -> 8 -> 4 -> 2 -> 1
```

Inside `wondrous.js` there is an implementation of this algorithm. Inside `wondrous.test.js` there is a single test for the function. The test currently fails.

Find the bugs in the program and complete more thorough testing with `jest`.
