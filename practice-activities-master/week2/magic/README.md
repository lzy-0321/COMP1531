## Lab03 - Challenge Exercise - Magic (Choice - 2 points)

Write a function `magic(square)` in a program `magic.js` that determines whether an array of n by n integers is a magic square.

Magic Squares are square arrays of numbers that have the interesting property that the numbers in each column, and in each row, all add up to the same total.

```javascript
> magic([[8,1,6],
           [3,5,7],
           [4,9,2]])
Magic square
```

The return value is one of the following strings:
 * `Magic square`
 * `Not a magic square`
 * `Invalid data: missing or repeated number`

Some tests have been added in `magic.test.js`. Ensure your solution passes those tests. You are not required to write your own tests.
