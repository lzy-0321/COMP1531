# Hello

## Setup

1. Please make sure you have completed `lab01_git` prior.
1. Copy the SSH clone link from Gitlab and clone this repository on either VLAB or your local machine. 
1. In your terminal, change your directory (using the `cd` command) into the newly cloned lab. To check if you have done this correctly, type `ls` in this new directory to see if you can see the relevant files (including [hello.js](hello.js)).
1. To proceed with this lab, you will need [nodejs](https://nodejs.org/en/). It is available on the CSE machines through the `node` command, although you are encouraged to also [install nodejs](https://nodejs.org/en/download/) on your local machine.

## Task

In [hello.js](hello.js), write JavaScript code that outputs "Hello, World!" in the terminal.

Your program should behave as follows:

```shell
$ node hello.js
Hello, World!
```

Use git to add, commit and push your changes to Gitlab. You may also find the command `git status` helpful. Refresh the Gitlab repository page and confirm that your changes are present.
