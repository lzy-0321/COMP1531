# Integers

Assuming you are familiar with arrays in C, arrays in node js are similar in that they are an ordered data structure supporting efficient random access. Unlike arrays in C, however, they are able to grow dynamically meaning their size does not need to be declared up front.

HINT: the javascript documentation is extensive and can give insight as to how to use certain functions: https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript

1. Open the `integers.js` file
2. Line 1 has declared a list of integers. You are required to add the number 6 to the list (using the `push` function) and then add all of the numbers up using a `for` loop and print out the result
3. Make the required edits to complete the above goal and run the `integers.js` in the same way you ran `hello.js`
