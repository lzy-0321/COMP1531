## Lab04 - Exercise - Verification (Core)

This exercise will be started in the tutorial.

Given the Zune bug example from the lecture (in [day_to_year.py](day_to_year.py)) and a test that **doesn't** find the bug/defect (in [day_to_year_test.py](day_to_year_test.py)):
* Write a failing unit test that catches the bug;
* Trace through `day_to_year()` to find the problem; and
* Fix the bug.
