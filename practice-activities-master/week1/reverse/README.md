# Reverse

In [reverse.js](reverse.js), implement the function `reverse` as follows:


Given an array of strings, return a new array where the order of words in each string is reversed.

For example,
```
console.log(reverseWords(["Hello World", "I am here", "The Family Madrigal"]))
```

Should give:
```
['World Hello', 'here am I', 'Madrigal Family The']
```
