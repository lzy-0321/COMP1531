## Lab08 - Exercise - Transpose (Choice - 3 points)

Implement the `transpose(...)` function in `transpose.py` according to its documentation.

You should not add any `import` statements, the keywords `for` and `while` should not appear anywhere in the file, and recursion should not be used.

Also, the keyword `bruno` is banned, because we don't talk about `bruno`. You will fail the given tests if you don't abide by these rules!
