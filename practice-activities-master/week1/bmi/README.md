## Lab02 - Exercise - BMI (Choice - 1 point)

Write a program `lab02_bmi.js` that calculates the user's BMI (body mass index). The formula is:

*BMI = weight in kilograms / (height in metres * height in metres)*

The program takes in a weight and a height from stdin and produces an output.

For example
```bash
What is your weight in kg? 70
What is your height in m? 1.82
Your BMI is 21.1
```
