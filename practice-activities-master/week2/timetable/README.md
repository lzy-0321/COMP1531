## Timetable

NPM has a powerful but small library `date-fns` which you can use to implement the function below.

1. Open `timetable.js` and look at the documentation for the function `timetable()`.
2. Write some tests in `timetable.test.js`. Run the tests to see that they fail.
3. Implement `timetable()` so that the tests pass.
