## Lab02 - Exercise - Count (Choice - 1 point)

1. Open `count.js` and read the documentation for stub function `countChar()`.
2. To better understand what the function needs to do, write further tests in `count.test.js`. Each test should be its own function.
3. Once you're satisfied you have a good set of tests, run them using `jest` and see that they fail.
4. Implement the `countChar()` function.
5. Run your tests to ensure they pass.
