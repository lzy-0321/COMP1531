## Package

A JSON file with data in it is stored in `shapecolour.json`. Write a function `most_common` inside program `extract.js` that decodes this file, and analyses the data to returns what the most common shape-colour pair is.

The return value of `extract.js` should be (for example, if the most common object pair is red circle) the dictionary:

```javascript
{
    "colour": "red",
    "shape": "circle",
}
```

Note: To import a file, always run your commands from the `package` folder.
